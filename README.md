Deep Audio Classifier using Deep Learning
This repository contains code and resources for a deep audio classifier using deep learning. The goal of this project is to develop a system that can accurately classify audio samples into predefined categories using deep learning techniques.

Requirements
Python (3.6 or higher)
TensorFlow (2.5.0 or higher)
Keras (2.4.3 or higher)
NumPy (1.19.5 or higher)
Librosa (0.8.1 or higher)
Matplotlib (3.3.4 or higher)


Usage
Prepare the dataset: Collect or obtain a dataset of audio samples in different categories. Each audio sample should be labeled with the corresponding category.

Preprocess the dataset: Use feature extraction techniques to convert the audio samples into suitable input representations for deep learning models. You can use libraries like Librosa to extract audio features such as spectrograms or mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).

Train the audio classifier: Run the train.py script, providing the path to the preprocessed dataset. The script will train the deep learning model using the extracted audio features and their corresponding labels.

Test the audio classifier: Run the test.py script, providing the path to the trained model and an audio sample. The script will process the audio sample, feed it into the model, and display the predicted category.

Project Structure
train.py: A script to train the deep audio classifier using the preprocessed dataset.
test.py: A script to test the deep audio classifier on an audio sample and display the predicted category.
model.py: Contains the architecture of the deep audio classifier model.
utils.py: Utility functions for data loading, preprocessing, and visualization.
data/: Directory to store the preprocessed dataset.
